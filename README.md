# Emotion Detection from TextAdd commentMore actions
Classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc., from text messages using NLP and machine learning. This project is valuable for education, mental health, chatbots, and feedback analysis—relevant for Tamizhan Skills LMS or mentoring.
## 🚩 Problem Statement
AI can be used in education and mental health by detecting student emotions from messages. Can we build a model to classify emotions from text?
## 🎯 Objective
- Classify emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.) from text using sentiment analysis and machine learning.
## 🗂️ Dataset
- Text messages labeled by emotion (e.g., [Kaggle Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp)).
- Typical classes: joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, etc.[1][5][6]
## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- (Optional) tensorflow/keras for deep learning
## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Load and inspect the labeled emotion dataset.
2. **Preprocessing:** 
    - Tokenize text
    - Remove stopwords
    - Use TF-IDF or pre-trained embeddings[1][4][5]
3. **Modeling:** Train a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or RNN)[5][6]
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate with precision, recall, and F1-score.
